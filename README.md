# LooksRare Subgraph

## To setup and deploy

For any of the subgraph: `blocks` as `[subgraph]`

1. Run the `cd subgraphs/[subgraph]` command to move to the subgraph directory.

2. Run the `yarn codegen` command to prepare the TypeScript sources for the GraphQL (generated/*).

3. Run the `yarn build` command to build the subgraph, and check compilation errors before deploying.

4. Run `graph auth --product hosted-service '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'`

5. Deploy via `yarn deploy`.
